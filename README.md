### 👋 Hi, I’m Chris


I'm a developer that is in love with python, (oh boy! what a great language). I worked with pandas, Keras, NumPy, Django, DRF, and so many other tools.
I have experience with machine learning (for fraud detection), I'm currently working on the backend side of things.


- 👀 I’m interested in develop some cool stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning kubernetes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some backend project.
- 📫 You can reach me on [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-medina-174590193/).

pd: Happiness is a journey, not a destination.
